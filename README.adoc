= Across Documentation Playbook

This repository contains the https://antora.org[Antora playbook] for the https://across.foreach.be[Across site] documentation.

== Building the documentation site

Make sure you have installed Antora per the https://docs.antora.org/antora/1.0/install/install-antora/[installation instructions].

Build the documentation site:

 $ antora site.yml

If you want to update the site documentation, you usually want to specify `--pull` as CLI argument.

 $ antora site.yml --pull

Open the site in your local browser.
Depending on your system you can use the `open` command.

 $ open build/site/index.html


== Creating the author workspace

For local development and site building you can checkout all related documentation repositories and use the author playbook.

Checkout the different documentation repositories in the `workspace` folder.

 $ ./initialize-workspace

This will clone each documentation repository separately in its own subdirectory.

Build the site using the author playbook, this will use the local checked out version of the repository.

 $ antora site-author.yml

When using the local repositories, specifying `--pull` is not necessary for updating.
